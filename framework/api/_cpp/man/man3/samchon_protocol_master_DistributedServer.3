A network driver for a distributed server\&. 

\fBDistributedServer\fP is an \fBDistributedSystem\fP specialized in server driver\&.

\fBDistributedSystem\fP class is an \fBExternalSystem\fP having role as \fBDistributedSystemRole\fP objects with performance index and history log allocation of \fBDistributedSystemRole\fP objects and have requsted \fBInvoke\fP message to related external system\&. 
.PP
The greatest difference between \fBDistributedSystem\fP and \fBExternalSystem\fP is, unlike the \fBExternalSystem\fP class which having is \fBExternalSystemRole\fP objects exclusively, \fBDistributedSystem\fP does not monopoly a \fBDistributedSystemRole\fP\&. The \fBDistributedSystemRole\fP can allocatedto multiple \fBDistributedSystem\fP\&.
.PP
\fBDistributedSystem\fP and \fBDistributedSystemRole\fP classes have performance index and history log archiving what they've requested to the related distributed system\&. Allocating \fBDistributedSystemRole\fP objects to DistributedSyste will be determined those performance index and history log for optimize distribution of elasped time about each \fBInvoke\fP message processing\&.

\fBExternalSystem\fP is a boundary class interacting with an external system by network communication\&. Also, \fBExternalSystem\fP is an abstract class that a network role, which one is server and which one is client, is not determined yet\&. 
.PP
The \fBExternalSystem\fP has ExternalSystemRole(s) groupped methods, handling \fBInvoke\fP message interacting with the external system, by subject or unit of a moudle\&. The \fBExternalSystemRole\fP is categorized in a 'control'\&.

.RE
.PP
The \fBExternalSystem\fP class takes a role of interaction with external system in network level\&. However, within a framework of Samchon Framework, a boundary class like the \fBExternalSystem\fP is not such important\&. You can find some evidence in a relationship between \fBExternalSystemArray\fP, \fBExternalSystem\fP and \fBExternalSystemRole\fP\&. 
.PP
Of course, the \fBExternalSystemRole\fP is belonged to an \fBExternalSystem\fP\&. However, if you access an \fBExternalSystemRole\fP from an \fBExternalSystemArray\fP directly, not passing by a belonged \fBExternalSystem\fP, and send an \fBInvoke\fP message even you're not knowing which \fBExternalSystem\fP is related in, it's called 'Proxy pattern'\&.
.PP
Like the explanation of 'Proxy pattern', you can utilize an \fBExternalSystemRole\fP as a proxy of an \fBExternalSystem\fP\&. With the pattern, you can only concentrate on \fBExternalSystemRole\fP itself, what to do with \fBInvoke\fP message, irrespective of the \fBExternalSystemRole\fP is belonged to which \fBExternalSystem\fP\&.

.RE
.PP
Returns an XML object that can represents the \fBEntity\fP containing member variables into properties\&. 
.PP
A member variable (not object, but atomic value like number, string or date) is categorized as a property within the framework of entity side\&. Thus, when overriding a \fBtoXML()\fP method and archiving member variables to an XML object to return, puts each variable to be a property belongs to only an XML object\&. 
.PP
Don't archive the member variable of atomic value to XML::value causing enormouse creation of XML objects to number of member variables\&. An \fBEntity\fP must be represented by only an XML instance (tag)\&.
