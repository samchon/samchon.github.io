A mediator of distributed system between master and slaves\&. 

\fBDistributedServerArrayMediator\fP is a \fBDistributedSystemArrayMediator\fP specialized in servers' driver\&. \fBDistributedServerArrayMediator\fP is a server for its master and also manages children servers' slaves\&.

\fBDistributedSystemArrayMediator\fP class is used to realizing a mediator system of tree-structured distributed processing system\&. \fBDistributedSystemArrayMediator\fP intermediates between origin-master(\fBDistributedSystemArray\fP) and its slaves(slave::DistributedSystem)\&. 
.PP
\fBDistributedSystemArrayMediator\fP is a master(DistributedSystemArray) within the framework of slaves systems (slave::DistributedSystem objects) and also can be a slave system (slave::DistributedSystem) within framework of its master(DistributedSystemArray) by having \fBDistributedSlaveSystemMediator\fP\&.

\fBDistributedSystemArray\fP class is an \fBExternalSystemArray\fP and an abstract class containing and managing distributed system drivers within framework of master\&. The \fBDistributedSystemArray\fP class allocates \fBDistributedSystemRole\fP objects to \fBDistributedSystem\fP objects for optimization\&. 
.PP
Unlike the \fBExternalSystemRole\fP class which is dependent on an \fBExternalSystem\fP, \fBDistributedSystemRole\fP is not dependent on a \fBDistributedSystem\fP and even can be allocated to multiple \fBDistributedSystem\fP objects\&. Allocation of DistributedSystemRole(s) to DistributedSystem(s) is determined by estimation of performance index pursuing best distribution\&. If number of \fBDistributedSystem\fP and \fBDistributedSystemRole\fP objects is not a lot, optimize by combined permuation algorithm\&. Else the objects are a lot, the allocation will be optimized by genetic algorithm\&.

\fBExternalSystemArray\fP is an abstract class containing and managing external system drivers\&. 
.PP
Also, \fBExternalSystemArray\fP can access to ExternalSystemRole(s) directly\&. With the method, you can use an \fBExternalSystemRole\fP as 'logical proxy' of an \fBExternalSystem\fP\&. Of course, the \fBExternalSystemRole\fP is belonged to an \fBExternalSystem\fP\&. However, if you access an \fBExternalSystemRole\fP from an \fBExternalSystemArray\fP directly, not passing by a belonged \fBExternalSystem\fP, and send an \fBInvoke\fP message even you're not knowing which \fBExternalSystem\fP is related in, the \fBExternalSystemRole\fP acted a role of proxy\&. 
.PP
It's called as 'Proxy pattern'\&. With the pattern, you can only concentrate on \fBExternalSystemRole\fP itself, what to do with \fBInvoke\fP message, irrespective of the \fBExternalSystemRole\fP is belonged to which \fBExternalSystem\fP\&.

Start interaction\&. An abstract method starting interaction with external systems\&. 
.PP
If external systems are servers, starts connection to them, else clients, opens a server and accepts the external systems\&. You can addict your own procudures of starting drivers, but if you directly override method of abstract \fBExternalSystemArray\fP, be careful about virtual inheritance\&.
