.PP 
A network driver for an external server\&. 

\fBExternalServer\fP is an \fBExternalSystem\fP specialized in server driver\&.

.PP
\fBExternalSystem\fP is a boundary class interacting with an external system by network communication\&. Also, \fBExternalSystem\fP is an abstract class that a network role, which one is server and which one is client, is not determined yet\&. 
.PP
The \fBExternalSystem\fP has ExternalSystemRole(s) groupped methods, handling \fBInvoke\fP message interacting with the external system, by subject or unit of a moudle\&. The \fBExternalSystemRole\fP is categorized in a 'control'\&.

.RE
.PP
The \fBExternalSystem\fP class takes a role of interaction with external system in network level\&. However, within a framework of Samchon Framework, a boundary class like the \fBExternalSystem\fP is not such important\&. You can find some evidence in a relationship between \fBExternalSystemArray\fP, \fBExternalSystem\fP and \fBExternalSystemRole\fP\&. 
.PP
Of course, the \fBExternalSystemRole\fP is belonged to an \fBExternalSystem\fP\&. However, if you access an \fBExternalSystemRole\fP from an \fBExternalSystemArray\fP directly, not passing by a belonged \fBExternalSystem\fP, and send an \fBInvoke\fP message even you're not knowing which \fBExternalSystem\fP is related in, it's called 'Proxy pattern'\&.
.PP
Like the explanation of 'Proxy pattern', you can utilize an \fBExternalSystemRole\fP as a proxy of an \fBExternalSystem\fP\&. With the pattern, you can only concentrate on \fBExternalSystemRole\fP itself, what to do with \fBInvoke\fP message, irrespective of the \fBExternalSystemRole\fP is belonged to which \fBExternalSystem\fP\&.

Construct data of the \fBEntity\fP from an XML object\&. Constructs the \fBEntityGroup\fP's own member variables only from the input XML object\&. 
.PP
Do not consider about constructing children \fBEntity\fP objects' data in \fBEntityGroup::construct()\fP\&. Those children \fBEntity\fP objects' data will constructed by their own \fBconstruct()\fP method\&. Even insertion of XML objects representing children are done by abstract method of \fBEntityGroup::toXML()\fP\&.

.SS "void start ()\fC [override]\fP, \fC [virtual]\fP"

.PP
Start interaction\&. An abstract method starting interaction with an external system\&. 
.PP
If an external systems are a server, starts connection and listening Inovoke message, else clients, just starts listening only\&. You also can addict your own procudures of starting the driver, but if you directly override method of abstract \fBExternalSystem\fP, be careful about virtual inheritance\&.

Implements \fBExternalSystem\fP\&.
.SS "auto toXML () const \-> std::shared_ptr<\fBlibrary::XML\fP>\fC [override]\fP, \fC [virtual]\fP"

.PP
Get an XML object represents the \fBEntityGroup\fP\&. Archives the \fBEntityGroup\fP's own member variables only to the returned XML object\&. 
.PP
Do not consider about archiving children \fBEntity\fP objects' data in \fBEntityGroup::toXML()\fP\&. Those children \fBEntity\fP objects will converted to XML object by their own \fBtoXML()\fP method\&. The insertion of XML objects representing children are done by abstract method of \fBEntityGroup::toXML()\fP\&.

.RS 4
Get an XML object represents the \fBEntity\fP\&. 
.RE
.PP
Returns an XML object that can represents the \fBEntity\fP containing member variables into properties\&. 
.PP
A member variable (not object, but atomic value like number, string or date) is categorized as a property within the framework of entity side\&. Thus, when overriding a \fBtoXML()\fP method and archiving member variables to an XML object to return, puts each variable to be a property belongs to only an XML object\&. 
.PP
Don't archive the member variable of atomic value to XML::value causing enormouse creation of XML objects to number of member variables\&. An \fBEntity\fP must be represented by only an XML instance (tag)\&.
