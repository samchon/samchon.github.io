A distributed slave server for mediation\&. 

\fBDistributedSlaveServerMediator\fP is a \fBDistributedSlaveSystemMediator\fP class specialized in server driver\&.

\fBDistributedSlaveSystemMediator\fP is an abstract class derived from \fBslave::SlaveSystem\fP for realizing tree-structured distriuted processins system\&. \fBDistributedSlaveSystemMediator\fP acts a slave system's role for its master, on the above level\&. 
.PP
\fBDistributedSystemArrayMediator\fP and \fBDistributedSlaveSystemMediator\fP classes are paired to act a mediator system role by acting their own role, master system role for below slaves and slave system role for above master system\&.

SlaveSystem, literally, means a slave system belongs to a maste system\&. 
.PP
The SlaveSystem class is used in opposite side system of \fBmaster::DistributedSystem\fP and \fBmaster::ParallelSystem\fP and reports elapsed time of each commmand (by \fBInvoke\fP message) for estimation of its performance\&.

\fBExternalSystem\fP is a boundary class interacting with an external system by network communication\&. Also, \fBExternalSystem\fP is an abstract class that a network role, which one is server and which one is client, is not determined yet\&. 
.PP
The \fBExternalSystem\fP has ExternalSystemRole(s) groupped methods, handling \fBInvoke\fP message interacting with the external system, by subject or unit of a moudle\&. The \fBExternalSystemRole\fP is categorized in a 'control'\&.

.PP
The \fBExternalSystem\fP class takes a role of interaction with external system in network level\&. However, within a framework of Samchon Framework, a boundary class like the \fBExternalSystem\fP is not such important\&. You can find some evidence in a relationship between \fBExternalSystemArray\fP, \fBExternalSystem\fP and \fBExternalSystemRole\fP\&. 
.PP
Of course, the \fBExternalSystemRole\fP is belonged to an \fBExternalSystem\fP\&. However, if you access an \fBExternalSystemRole\fP from an \fBExternalSystemArray\fP directly, not passing by a belonged \fBExternalSystem\fP, and send an \fBInvoke\fP message even you're not knowing which \fBExternalSystem\fP is related in, it's called 'Proxy pattern'\&.
.PP
Like the explanation of 'Proxy pattern', you can utilize an \fBExternalSystemRole\fP as a proxy of an \fBExternalSystem\fP\&. With the pattern, you can only concentrate on \fBExternalSystemRole\fP itself, what to do with \fBInvoke\fP message, irrespective of the \fBExternalSystemRole\fP is belonged to which \fBExternalSystem\fP\&.
